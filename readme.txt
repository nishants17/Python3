############### This a readme for a small python user input application ###################
Here we have built a movie database application wherein a user can add movies of his choice to the collection based on the user menu provided.

As a user I would like to be able to
    1. Add new movies to my collection to keep track of all my movies
    2. List all the movies in my collection to see what movies I already have
    3. Find movie by using movie title

Implementation plan:
    1. Where are we going to store movies in our code?
       Storing them in a python list
    2. Decide what data we want to show for each movie?
       Dictionary? Movie title,director,actor, actress, release year,budget
    3. Show the user a menu and let them pick an option
       Built a function user_menu that performs all the operations
    4. Implement each requirement in turn each as a separate function
       All operations have separate functions
    5. Stop running the program if you type 'q' in the menu
       exit()

Future scope:
    1. Can store the data in an actual database location like MS Access or SQL Server for durability.
